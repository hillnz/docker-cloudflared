# cloudflared

Unofficial Docker image containing [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared).

## Usage

By default, prints the version and exits.
To do something useful, override the command, for example:
```
docker run jonoh/cloudflared tunnel run my-tunnel
```

### Environment Variables

You can see cloudflared's supported environment variables by running `cloudflared [<subcommand>] --help`.

In addition, these custom environment variables are supported. 
If all of them are set (and the command isn't overridden) then the image will execute `cloudflared tunnel run` with the configuration specified.

Name            | Description
---             | ---
ACCOUNT_ID      | Cloudflare Account ID
TUNNEL_ID       | Tunnel ID
TUNNEL_NAME     | Tunnel Name
TUNNEL_SECRET   | Tunnel Secret
PUID            | User ID for the daemon (see Volumes)

### Volumes

Mount `/config` so that cloudflared's configuration file can be saved.

The daemon runs as a user with id 65532 (like the official image). If this causes permission errors, you can override the uid by setting the PUID environment variable.

### Example

Using docker-compose:
```yaml
services:
    cloudflared:
        image: jonoh/cloudflared
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - ACCOUNT_ID=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
            - TUNNEL_ID=2e7d56f0-d51e-4c14-9330-5707b45d0813
            - TUNNEL_NAME=helloworld
            - TUNNEL_SECRET=aGVsbG93b3JsZF9oZWxsb3dvcmxkX2hlbGxvd29ybGQK
            - TUNNEL_URL=http://some_service:8080
        volumes:
            - ./config:/config
```

## Tags

Tags mirror the cloudflared version, or you can just use `latest`.

## Motivation

The official builds are only for amd64.
There are other unofficial images, however I couldn't find one that was both multi-platform, and which was always kept updated.
